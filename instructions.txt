For submission, just create a repo in github and name it se3231-machine-learning and invite me as collaborator or do the google classroom stuff that Mykiell suggested. 

Attached with your code, provide an answer to the following questions:

1. Why did you choose this dataset?

- I wanted to know whether there is any correlation between Playing Hours and Grade

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

You can put your answers in a doc file or a notepad or as a comment on your code. Just make sure to properly name it.
