1. Why did you choose this dataset?

I took a look at the datasets and found that gameandgrade.csv contains data that I can mostly relate with. I found the other datasets to be far too complicated for me to interpret. Aside from that, it piqued my interest to find out what factors/variables impact grade the most and it made me gain an interest in creating a model that'll allow me to predict grades based on those factors.

2. What is your conclusion upon conducting linear regression on this dataset?

All in all, I realized that there's a lot more factors that impact grades than the ones present in the dataset. Based on the results I got, the prediction model is not that reliable with a lot of variation. However, something interesting that I found was that it was the Parents' level of education is the factor that greatly impacted the grades the most as compared to the others. Initially, I used the Playing Hours variable expecting it to yield the most impact may it be negatively or positively and from there I was able to determine that it was the Parents' level of education that was more correlated with the grades.

It makes sense considering how a more educated parent may provide and enable their children with more access and opportunity to education compared to those of none.

3. How relevant is linear regression today?

Linear regression allows us to predict and interpret given data the easiest way possible without needing the heavy technical work required by other models such as Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and etc. Also, it serves as a foundational model that'll help serve the other models later on. With Linear Regression being simple and easy enough to perform, after determining that it is not enough, from there you are able which model you should use in order to get a more accurate result or prediction from your dataset.
